A fully parameterized and generic Verilog implementation of our modular switched multi-ported SRAM-based memory compiler, together with previous approaches are provided as open source hardware. A run-in-batch flow manager to simulate and synthesize various designs with various parameters in batch using Altera's ModelSim and Quartus is also provided.
